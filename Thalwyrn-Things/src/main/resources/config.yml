## Welcome to the Thalwyrn config file!
## This file is used to configure the plugin to your liking.
## If you find yourself in possession of this plugin, that's surprising as I'm using it internally for my own server


## Prefix for all plugin messages to the player.
prefix: "<GRADIENT:ffdb3a>[Thalwyrn]</GRADIENT:f79035>"

## Scoreboard configuration MAX 15 LINES, longer will truncate
## If you want to disable the scoreboard, set enable-scoreboard to false
enable-scoreboard: false

## Configure the scoreboard content here, colors, hex colors, gradients & placeholders are supported.
## We use the Iridium Colour API you can find more info here: https://github.com/Iridium-Development/IridiumColorAPI
